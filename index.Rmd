# Introduction

Shiny is a powerful R package which allows you to create interactive web applications using the R programming language. It is particularly useful for creating applications that run on data and include some sort of data analysis or visualization. In addition to leveraging the power of R and its thousands of packages, one of the big benefits of shiny is the ease of developing applications using R only. Although it is possible to incorporate more traditional web design languages such as custom CSS or Javascript into your shiny application, it is not required.

# Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have the shiny package installed on your system. You can download shiny from CRAN using the command `install.packages("shiny")`. The RStudio IDE contains a basic shiny application template you can use to create your first shiny application. To access this template, click on the new document icon in the top left corner of the IDE and select "Shiny Web App...". This will create the R script file `app.R` which contains the basic components of a shiny application. You can use this simple shiny application as a starting point for building your own applications.
